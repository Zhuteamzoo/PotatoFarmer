# Challenges

1.The pitch of the camera angle wasn't always 180 degrees so over time it would make the player turn and go back a bit which would get it stuck onto blocks
## Fix 
I decided to make the bot hold w the whole time so it would make the bot constantly moving forward such that it won't go backwards and get stuck

---
2. There was no delay between when i would switch layers and start moving the other way
## Fix
I added a little delay after i switched layers so that it wouldn't accidentaly break and stay on the same layer.
