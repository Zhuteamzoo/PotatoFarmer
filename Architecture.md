# System Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. Input Automation
   - Simulates consistent player actions using keyboard input.

2. Visual State Detection
   - Reads on-screen coordinates using computer vision rather than internal game data.

3. Control Logic
   - Determines when to switch farm layers based on spatial position.

These components operate together in a loop, allowing the bot to function autonomously.
