# PotatoFarmer

**PotatoFarmer** is a small automation project I built to explore how repetitive tasks can be optimized through code. The program controls a bot that automatically farms potatoes in Minecraft, allowing resources to be gathered efficiently without constant manual input.

## Motivation

I built this project while playing Minecraft with friends during a school break. Farming potatoes was necessary for our shared gameplay, but it quickly became a repetitive and time-consuming task. At the same time, I was balancing a demanding schedule that included school applications, competitive hockey games, and regular practices.

Rather than spending hours repeating the same in-game actions, I decided to approach the problem analytically: **could I automate the process instead?** This project became an opportunity to apply programming skills to a real (albeit virtual) problem, turning a routine task into an exercise in efficiency and problem-solving.

## What This Project Explores

- Automation of repetitive actions   
- Precision and timing in programmed behavior  
- Iterative testing and debugging to improve reliability

## What I Learned

Building this bot taught me how small inefficiencies add up and how thoughtful automation can save significant time. More importantly, it reinforced the idea that programming is not just about writing code, but about **analyzing a process, breaking it down, and designing a system that improves it**.

## Next Steps

I am interested in extending this project by improving adaptability (handling different farm layouts), optimizing efficiency, and applying similar automation concepts to more complex systems beyond games.
