# How it works
I'm using the pyautogui and keyboard feature in python to hold down keys for me in Minecraft. I changed my break button to x so I could hold down since the left click wasn't working
I also added OpenCV to read the coordinates of my charachter which where displayed in the top left corner of my screen using Lunar Client. Once i hit a certain coordinate i would change layers in my farm
The youtube video of my bot working is on my youtube channel
